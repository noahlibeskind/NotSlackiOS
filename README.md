# NotSlackiOS
A basic version of a commonly used professional messaging platform. Built with Swift on Xcode, for devices running iOS.

Users can create workspaces, add and remove colleagues to/from workspaces, create channels, and write messages within channels that display in chronological order. Admins (or creators) of workspaces can delete any messages, channels, or the workspace itself. Guests of each workspace can only delete their own messages. Accounts are password protected and secured with JSON Web Tokens. The app makes real network calls and utilizes an API that I built as well.

The code for this app is in a private repository that I am glad to share with any of my colleagues and potential employers. Unfortunately it cannot be shared online because this app is very similar to the solution to a programming assignment in a mobile applications course at UC Santa Cruz.
